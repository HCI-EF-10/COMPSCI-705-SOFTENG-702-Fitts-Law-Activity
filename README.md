# COMPSCI 705/SOFTENG 702 Fitts' Law Activity
This Fitts's Law activity is based around experiential learning.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
In order to run the activity you must have NodeJS installed which can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/

<h2>How to start the application</h2>
To run the program, simply navigate to the this folder, run the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies required, and then run "npm start" to actually start the task.

<h3>What should happen</h3>
Upon running those commands, a webpage should appear, instructing you on how to use the task.

Additionally a select box will be there to select the type of prompts (either activity based prompts or theory based prompts) which should give you further tips on how you can improve the UI design within the task. <br><br>

Within the task there should be sliders to adjust the size and position of the currently selected menu - you can play around with these as you like <br><br>

Once you finish experimenting with the size and shape of the menus, you should run the test by clicking the corresponding button in the settings pane, from there you will be guided through scenarios using the interface that you have adjusted to demonstrate the effects of how the size and shapes affect how difficult it is to use an interface (as Fitts's Law explains). Prompts will appear to guide you throughout the scenarios.
